# Automated Installation Tool for Nested ESXi with Kickstart 

## Overview
This tool is designed to assist in the automatic installation of Nested ESXi through Kickstart.

## Functionality
When the code is executed, Web&API, DHCP, and TFTP services are initiated.

- **Web&API**
  - The default port number is 80. It processes POST requests containing the information for the ESXi to be deployed, creates ks.cfg, determines the DHCP lease IP corresponding to the ESXi's MAC address, and retains the mapping information. It also maintains the mapping of ks.cfg and the MAC address, responding with the appropriate file to GET requests from the target IP. This service also handles the upload of ESXi ISO files. Uploaded ISOs are edited for PXE installation.
- **DHCP**
  - Executes IP address lease for each MAC address according to the mapping information created by the API. The DHCP options include the bootfile of the ESXi version and the information of the TFTP server contained in the POST request received by the API. Discover messages from MAC addresses without mapping information are ignored. By default, the DHCP lease range is set to consider the entire CIDR range of the service port as a valid lease range. Although duplicate checks are performed using ARP, it is recommended that the network of the service port be dedicated to Nested ESXi.
- **TFTP**
  - Responds with the ESXi files uploaded and edited to the Web.

By default, the tool checks the ethernet interfaces on the OS at startup and determines the first interface it finds as the API port and the second as the service port. The following are launched on each interface:

- API port serves
  - API
- Service port serves
  - API, DHCP, TFTP

Also, by default, it creates a directory for file upload (files) and a directory for saving ks.cfg (ks) on the execution directory at startup.

These default settings can be changed using environment variables.

## Requirements
- If using the default settings, prepare a Linux with two interfaces.
- Execution requires root user permissions.
- Both interfaces should have IPv4 addresses assigned.
- The network of the ESXi that boots with PXE must be on the same network as the service port.

## Environment Variables
The default values can be changed by setting the following environment variables:

| Environment variables name | Default value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `API_SERVER_PORT` | `80` | Changes the port number of the API. |
| `KS_DIR_PATH` | `./` | Changes the directory where ks.cfg is saved. | 
| `FILE_DIR_PATH` | `./files` | Changes the directory where ISO is uploaded. |
| `LOG_FILE_PATH` | `/var/log/ks-server.log` | Changes the log output file. |
| `SERVICE_IP_ADDR` | The second nic ip address | Starts the service port on the interface with the IP in this variable. |
| `DHCP_START_IP` | The second nic CIDR range first | Sets the start IP of the DHCP lease range. The end IP setting is also required. |
| `DHCP_END_IP` | The second nic CIDR range end| Sets the end IP of the DHCP lease range. The start IP setting is also required. |

## Usage
1. Increase the limit of file descriptors.  
Please increase the maximum number of open files according to your environment if you use bios boot. Since approximately 200 files are opened per installation of a single Nested ESXi with bios boot, the default value of 1024 as a general linux os would not be sufficient if you are installing 10 units simultaneously.
    ```bash
    ulimit -n 50000
    ```

2. Execute the code.
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

3. Access the Web and upload the ESXi ISO file.
    ```
    http://<Web&API IP>:<API_SERVER_PORT>
    ```

4. Create a Nested ESXi VM and note down the MAC address of the vnic for PXE boot. Do not start the VM at this point.

5. Send a POST request to the API for the VM created in step 3.

    - **URI**: 
        ```
        POST http://<Web&API IP>:<API_SERVER_PORT>/ks
        ```
    - **Required Headers**: 
        ```
        Content-Type: application/json
        ```
    - **Body**: 
        - `macaddress`: MAC address of the interface used for PXE boot
        - `password`: Root user password of the Nested ESXi
        - `ip`: IP address of vmk0
        - `netmask`: Network mask of vmk0
        - `gateway`: Default gateway of vmk0
        - `nameserver`: DNS server of vmk0
        - `hostname`: Hostname of the Nested ESXi
        - `vlanid`: VLAN ID of vmk0
        - `keyboard`: Keyboard layout of the OS, the default value is English(`US Default`).
        - `isofilename`: Filename of the ISO to be installed. It must have the same name as the uploaded ISO file.
        - `cli`: CLI commands to be executed after installation. Please note that these will not work if Secure Boot is enabled.
    Example POST request:
    ```
    POST http://<Web&API IP>:<API_SERVER_PORT>/ks
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "macaddress": "00:50:56:99:c4:74",
        "password": "VMware1!",
        "ip": "192.168.1.1",
        "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
        "gateway": "192.168.1.254",
        "nameserver": "192.168.1.250",
        "hostname": "testesxi001.vsphere.local",
        "vlanid": 11,
        "keyboard": "Japanese",
        "isofilename": "VMware-VMvisor-Installer-7.0U3c-19193900.x86_64.iso",
        "cli": [
            "vim-cmd hostsvc/enable_ssh",
            "vim-cmd hostsvc/start_ssh",
            "vim-cmd hostsvc/enable_esx_shell",
            "vim-cmd hostsvc/start_esx_shell"
        ]
    }
    ```

6. Power on the Nested ESXi VM. The installation will begin automatically.

7. After the installation is complete, send a DELETE request to delete the corresponding mac address and ip address mapping information.

    Example DELETE request:
    ```
    DELETE http://<Web&API IP>:<API_SERVER_PORT>/ks/00-50-56-99-c4-74
    ```

## Other Information
You can use the following API to verify the mapping of iso file names to ESXi versions. This is useful for checking uploaded iso files and for deciding the guest_os_version of Nested ESXi and the VDS version to use when deploying a Nested vSphere environment automatically in conjunction with tools like Ansible.

- **URI**:
  ```
  GET http://<Web&API IP>:<API_SERVER_PORT>/esxi-versions
  ```

- **Response Sample**:
  ```
